> If you're a visual learner, and you'd like a graphical way to interact with ContainerLab labs, you can install the VS Code Extension 'ContainerLab'

# I. Install VS Code
  A. Before installing the extension, you must install VS Code itself.
  B. If you are on Debian (as I am), you can run the following command to install VS Code via APT:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install code
  ```
  C. Now that VS Code is installed, open the program and click on the 'Extensions' icon in the menu on the left-hand side. The icon should look this this: ![VS Code Extension icon](/images/vsCodeExt)
